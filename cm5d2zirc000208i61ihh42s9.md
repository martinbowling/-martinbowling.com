# 🚀 DeepBuild: Where AI Meets Code Magic!

Hey there, code enthusiasts! Martin Bowling here! 👋 Today I'm pulling back the curtain on **DeepBuild**, our AI-powered software wizard. Get ready for a fun journey through the codebase where I'll show you how everything ticks, why we made certain choices, and how you can join the party with your own contributions!

## 🤔 What Is DeepBuild?

Think of DeepBuild as your AI-powered coding companion that can spawn entire software projects from scratch! We've mixed together some awesome ingredients:

* ⚛️ **Next.js** (powering our slick front end and serverless API routes)
    
* 📝 **TypeScript** (because who doesn't love type safety?)
    
* 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** (for that pixel-perfect styling)
    
* 🪝 **Custom React hooks** and context providers (keeping our state game strong)
    
* 💾 **IndexedDB** (via a custom file manager) to store and manage project data in your browser
    

When you put it all together, users can:

1. Dream up a project idea
    
2. Watch as AI crafts a detailed project blueprint
    
3. Have a chat with the AI to refine the details
    
4. See complete files materialize like magic! ✨

## 🎯 The Core Concept

Here's the secret sauce:

1. 🗣️ **You** describe your dream project
    
2. 🤖 **The AI** cooks up some JSON containing:
    
    * 📋 A **Project Brief** (the grand plan)
        
    * ❓ **Clarifying questions** (getting those details just right)
        
    * 📁 A **file structure** (the blueprint)
        
3. 💬 **You** chat with the AI to refine everything
    
4. ⚡ **DeepBuild** transforms those ideas into real, working code!
    

Here's a peek at the prompts making the magic happen:

```ts
export const BRIEF_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
  You are DeepBuild, an elite software engineer...
  ...
  Remember: Always wrap your response in <final_json> tags and ensure it's valid JSON.
`;

export const IMPLEMENTATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
  You are DeepBuild, an elite software engineer...
  ...
  Remember: Always wrap your response in <final_json> tags and ensure it's valid JSON.
`;
```

## 🏗️ A Tour of the Code

### 1\. 🎨 Root Layout & Global Styles

* **File:** `app/layout.tsx`
    
* **File:** `app/globals.css`
    

Our `layout.tsx` is where the magic begins! It sets up the main HTML structure and brings in our `FileProvider` context:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <FileProvider>{children}</FileProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

We're all in on **Tailwind** for styling, with dark mode support baked right into `globals.css` 🌙

### 2\. 📊 Main Dashboard

* **File:** `app/page.tsx`
    

The dashboard is your command center! Here's where you can:

* 🆕 Create shiny new projects
    
* 🗑️ Clean up old ones
    
* 📦 Export as `.zip` files
    
* ⚙️ Tweak your AI settings
    

```tsx
export default function Dashboard() {
  // Hooks, state, event handlers here...
  // ...
  return (
    <div className="container py-8 px-12">
      {/* Header + new project button */}
      {/* List of projects as ProjectCard */}
      {/* Settings dialog */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3\. 🧩 Components Galore

Our `components/` folder is where all the real action happens! Here's what we're working with:

* 🎴 `ProjectCard.tsx`: Shows off each project with its current status
    
* 🆕 `NewProjectModal.tsx`: A sleek dialog for birthing new projects
    
* 🖼️ `ProjectView.tsx`: The main stage where all the magic happens
    
* ✏️ `Editor.tsx`: Powered by `@monaco-editor/react` for that pro-level coding experience
    

Check out how we tie everything together in `ProjectView.tsx`:

```tsx
<div className="flex-1 flex">
  <div className="w-64 border-r border-border bg-muted/30">
    <FileTree
      files={project.files}
      selectedFile={selectedFile}
      onFileSelect={setSelectedFile}
      onFileRefresh={handleFileRefresh}
    />
  </div>

  <div className="flex-1 border-r border-border">
    {selectedFile ? (
      <Editor
        file={selectedFile}
        language={getLanguageFromPath(selectedFile.path)}
      />
    ) : (
      <div className="h-full flex items-center justify-center text-muted-foreground">
        Select a file to view or edit
      </div>
    )}
  </div>

  <div className="w-96 flex flex-col h-full">
    <ProjectChat
      // ...
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4\. 💾 IndexedDB 'FileManager'

* **File:** `lib/fileOperations.ts`
    

We're keeping it local with IndexedDB for data storage! Our `FileManager` class handles all the heavy lifting:

```ts
class FileManager {
  private db: IDBDatabase | null = null;

  constructor() {
    this.initDB();
  }

  async saveProject(name: string, brief: ProjectBrief): Promise<string> {
    // Creates a new project + files in IndexedDB
  }

  // ...
}
```

No server required - everything stays right in your browser! 🏠

### 5\. 🤖 Prompts and AI Hooks

* **File:** `hooks/useChat.ts`
    

The AI communication happens through `sendChatMessage()` in `lib/api.ts`. We can talk to either the **DeepSeek** or **Hyperbolic** model, depending on your preferences. We scan responses for those special `<final_json>` tags to extract the structured data we need:

```ts
const response = await sendChatMessage(apiMessages);
const match = response.match(/<final_json>([^]*?)<\/final_json>/);
let parsedResponse = null;

if (match) {
  parsedResponse = JSON.parse(match[1].trim());
} else {
  parsedResponse = JSON.parse(response); // fallback
}
```

## ⚡ Example: Creating a New Project

Here's what happens when you hit that "New Project" button:

1. 📝 **You** enter your **Project Name** and describe your vision
    
2. 🤖 **DeepBuild** sends your description to the AI with our special `BRIEF_SYSTEM_PROMPT`:
    
    ```ts
    const briefResponse = await sendMessage(
      `Create a project brief for the following utility app: ${description}`,
      'brief'
    );
    ```
    
3. 🎁 The AI returns structured JSON with everything we need
    
4. 💾 We store it all in IndexedDB with a fresh `projectId`
    
5. 💬 You can then chat with the AI to generate each file
    

Here's the code that kicks it all off:

```tsx
const response = await sendMessage(
  `Create a project brief for a ${description}. Include implementation details...`,
  'brief'
);
const match = response.match(/<final_json>([^]*?)<\/final_json>/);
// ...
const parsedResponse = JSON.parse(match[1].trim());
// Then we create the project in IndexedDB via fileManager.saveProject
```
